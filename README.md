# The ReFresh theme for Hugo

**ReFresh** is a theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator _highly_ modified from the awesome [Fresh](https://github.com/StefMa/hugo-fresh) theme (below you can find the list of changes to the original theme). 

You can find a live demo of the original Fresh theme [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-fresh/) or a demo of the Hugo ReFresh theme [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-refresh/).

You can find another example of ReFresh theme in [my personal website](https://rjordaney.is/).

> This theme is intended for personal website and blog. If you'd like to extend the theme to include other functionalities submit a pull request.

## Getting started

To create a new site using Hugo ReFresh:

```bash
# Create site and cd into it
hugo new site my-site && cd my-site

# Clone the ReFresh theme into the themes folder
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/PippoRJ/hugo-refresh.git themes/hugo-refresh

# Remove the default config
rm config.toml

# Fetch the example config
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PippoRJ/hugo-refresh/master/exampleSite/config.yaml

# Run the site locally
hugo server -D

# Open the site in your browser
open http://localhost:1313
```

To run the Example Site using Hugo ReFresh:

```bash
# Create site and cd into it
hugo new site my-site && cd my-site

# Clone the ReFresh theme into the themes folder
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/PippoRJ/hugo-refresh themes/hugo-refresh

# Remove the default config
rm config.toml

# Copy the Example site content and configuration in my-site
cp -R themes/hugo-refresh/exampleSite/* ./

# Open the site in your browser
hugo server -D
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see `error: failed to transform resource: TOCSS: failed to transform "style.sass"` when attempting to run your `hugo server`, make sure you have the extended version of Hugo installed:

```bash
# On Ubuntu:
snap refresh hugo --channel=extended
```

## Statistics counter

You can enter your Google / Yandex / etc statistic counter code into the `layouts/partials/counter.html`. Code will be generated right after open `<body>` tag.

## Custom HEAD

If you want to include custom scripts at the end of the `HEAD` section, create a file in `layouts/partials/custom_head.html` and add your content there.

## Customizing your page

There are different configuration options for Hugo ReFresh including options for: the navbar, the sidebar, the homepage, fonts, colours landing, stats counters and images. 
Read the comments in the `config.yaml` file to know more.

The images specified in the `config.yaml` file need to be placed in the directory specified by the `assetDir` option in the config file. 
E.g.: set `assetDir: "static"` to the set the default folder the `static` folder of your site.

## Customization options for a regular page

These are the options that you can define is the front matter of a regular page:

```
---
title: "My Awesome Title"
date: 2019-06-03T21:51:13+01:00
draft: false
hideLastModified: true
summaryImage: "images/system.jpg" 
keepImageRatio: true
tags: ["Tag1", "tag2", "tag 3"]
summary: "This is a custom summary for my article"
showInMenu: true
---
```

* `summaryImage`: it is used to specify the image to be used in the summary 

* `keepImageRatio`: it is used to force the aspect ratio of the image to be kept. The default value is **false**.

* `summary`: it is used to specify the summary of an article instead of taking it from the article itself.

* `hideLastModified`: it is used to hide the the timestamp added at the end of the article.

* `showInMenu`: it is used to show the article in the top right menu. 

* `tags`: it is the list of tags for the article; they will be used to build the left sidebar.


To avoid path problems when specifying the `summaryImage`, it is recommended to define a regular page as a leaf bundle. The example above will result in:

```
* my_awesome_title (folder)
   * index.md (file)
   * images (folder)
      * system.jpg (file)
```

## Multilanguage support

To chose the default language you need to set the `DefaultContentLanguage` setting in the `config.yaml` file.
(You can also have multiple languages at the same time, see `exampleSite/config.yaml` for an example.)

The language supported are:

* English 

* Spanish

* French

* Italian

* Russian

* Chinese

* Polish

* German

* Portuguese

If you want to add a missing language please submit a feature request.


## List of modifications from the original theme

* The ReFresh theme was transformed from _single page_ template to _multipage_.

* Added multilanguage support.

* The left side menu now contains page tags along with theirs post counter.

* The _list_ and _terms_ types of pages contain a list of the post summaries.

* The images used to build the summaries can be resized to allow better usage of the bandwidth.

* The js and css files can be minified (with a configurable option on the `config.yaml`).

* The menu is automatically built following the structure of the `content` folder. Two levels are allowed at the moment.

* The `navbar-burger` used in the original theme's menu is removed (it was displayed when the page was resized).

* The `.sass` files are now processed with `resources.ExecuteAsTemplate` so that it is possible to use variables from the `config.yaml`.

* Options in the `config.yaml` are added to configure the font-family for the navbar, sidebar and content of the a page.

* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) (the css framework the theme is based on) is now updated to version 0.7.5 because in the new version the class _content_ has a separate style to allow modification that will impact only the contents of the posts.

* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) was added to better highlight the code sections of the posts. I chose the style **monokai-sublime**.

* [highlightjs-line-number.js](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/) was added to have the line number at the beginning of each line of code in a code sections of a post.

* A minimal version of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) was added to allow LaTeX style mathematical expressions to be placed in the site.

* Several other options are added to personalise the content of a post. 

* A shortcode is added to resize the images and save bandwidth in a post content.

* A shortcode is added to show multiple tabs.

* Four shortcodes are added to show code: inline, in page, in page wide, in tabs. 

* The loaders images are now processed with `resources.ExecuteAsTemplate` so that they take the main colour of the theme (defined in `config.yaml`)

* The _favicon_ is processed with `resources.ExecuteAsTemplate` to follow the main colour of the page.

* Added Open Graph meta tags to each post for easy-sharing on social media sites.

* All the js and css files are loaded locally, i.e., not loaded from third party sites.
